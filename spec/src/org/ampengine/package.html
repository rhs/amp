    <p>
      Connections are the primary unit of resource management.
      Sessions and Links are components of connections. When the
      Connection is destroyed/discarded, any resources associated with
      the Sessions and Links are automatically destroyed or discarded
      as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of the Connection, Session, and Link endpoints share a
      common state model. Note that although this follows the same
      pattern as the protocol state model for open/close, begin/end,
      and attach/detach, this does not necessarily correspond one to
      one to the protocol state model for endpoints. For example the
      engine implementation may detach/reattach a link endpoint
      without visibly changing the external state.
    </p>

    <p>
      The state of each endpoint is divided into two parts, one
      reflecting the state of the local endpoint, and the other
      reflecting the state of the remote endpoint as last
      communicated.

     LOCAL:
       UNINIT
       ACTIVE
       CLOSED

     REMOTE:
       UNINIT
       ACTIVE
       CLOSED
    </pre>

    <p>In total there are 9 possible states:</p>

    <pre>
     LOCAL             REMOTE             Example
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     UNINIT            UNINIT             A newly created connection.

     UNINIT            ACTIVE             A remotely initiated connection
                                          prior to full establishment.

     UNINIT            CLOSED             A remotely initiated connection that
                                          has been closed prior to full
                                          establishment.

     ACTIVE            UNINIT             A locally initiated connection prior
                                          to full establishment.

     ACTIVE            ACTIVE             A fully established connection.

     ACTIVE            CLOSED             A remotely terminated connection.

     CLOSED            UNINIT             A locally initiated connection that
                                          has been closed prior to full
                                          establishment.

     CLOSED            ACTIVE             A locally terminated connection.

     CLOSED            CLOSED             A fully terminated connection.
  </pre>

  <p>
    Additionally each endpoint has a local and remote error slot which
    may be filled with additional information regarding why the
    endpoint was transitioned to CLOSED.

      how do we deal with send and receive modes on individual transfers?
